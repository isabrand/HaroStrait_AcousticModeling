## San Juan Island (Haro Strait) Hydrophone Mooring Modeling

This repo holds my models for source localization and sound propagation modeling around a proposed hydrophone mooring in Haro Strait, off the west coast of San Juan Island. I tested several different models, some using Bellhop and some using straight math, some with TDOA and some with MFP beamforming.
